title: Swing Explorer is Back
---

After a lengthy hiatus, Swing Explorer is back on the web!

We are migrating to GitHub for source code and release hosting. The project can be found at the [swingexplorer/swingexplorer-core](https://github.com/swingexplorer/swingexplorer-core) repo. Issue reports are welcome.

Maven Central releases are coming soon. In the mean time, the old 1.6.0 Swing Explorer release is available on the [Downloads page](/Download.html)

[Andrew Janke](https://apjanke.net) has joined Swing Explorer's author Maxim Zakharenkov as an assistant maintainer, and is working on setting up the new hosting and release situation.

We are resuming active maintenance of Swing Explorer and will be making sure it continues to work on the newer releases of Java.
